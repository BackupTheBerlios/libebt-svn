README for libebt

The libebt library provides a clean way of getting human-readable backtrace
messages in C++. It uses the RAII (resource acquisition is initialisation)
idiom to manage backtrace stack items.

Developer documentation in HTML format is available via 'doxygen'. Use
'make doxygen' to create it.
