README for libebt
=================

The libebt library provides a clean way of getting human-readable backtrace
messages in C++. It uses the RAII (resource acquisition is initialisation)
idiom to manage backtrace stack items.

Developer documentation in HTML format is available via 'doxygen'. Use
'make doxygen' to create it.

libebt was written by Ciaran McCreesh <ciaranm@gentoo.org>.
